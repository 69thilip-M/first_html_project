      >
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
      are many ways of doing this. The web needs both raw data -- fresh
      hypertext or old plain text files, or smart servers giving views of
      existing databases. See

      <br />Suggest someone else does
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe
      you know a system which it would be neat to have on the web. How about
      suggesting to the person involved that they put up a W3 server?
      <br />Manage a subject area
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you
      know something of what's going on in a particular field, organization or
      country, would you like to keep up-to-date an overview of online data?
